# AWS Technical Professional Online Training 
## Module 1: Introduction to AWS 
### Part I: Introduction to AWS 
Cloud computing – on demand IT resources. Accessible online and pay as you go. 
It address the following issues of the traditional computing model: 
Low Cost 
Elastic 
Flexible 
Secure 
AWS 
No upfront investment 
Low on-going costs 
Focus on innovation 
Flexible capacity – provision the resources you need, turn off what you don't need  
Speed and agility – fast and on demand provisioning 
Global reach on-demand 
 
On-premises server setup  
slow and expensive 
Large initial purchases – install and configure,  
physical space,  cooling, power 
Cabling, networking, racks, servers, storage 
Labour, certification 
Labour, patches, and upgrade cycles 
Systems Administrator 
Fixed capacity – idle resources, inadequate capacity 
Procurement setup – lengthy, labour-intensive provisioning 
Limited geographic locations 
 
 
 
Part II: AWS Infrastructure 
Choosing which region – optimise latency, minimise cost, regulatory requirements 
Should encrypt data since traffic transfers over the internet Z 
Availability Zone (AZ) - collection of data centres within each region, isolated from other AZs, Connected by a low-latency (high response) link 
Host a content delivery network (CDN) 
 
Module 2: AWS Core Services 
Compute – Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Amazon ECS (EC2 Container Services), AWS Lambda 
Amazon EC2 – Memory, Compute, Storage and I/O, GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) optimised, General Purpose 
Easily resize an instance up or down 
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - Choose an operating system type and version, create and customise your own AMIs 
Amazon EC2: Instance Types 
General Purpose – balanced set of resources, high performance on a low cost platform 
For applications that require balanced CPU and memory performance like coding, high traffic content management systems, and memcached  
Compute Optimised instance – has a proportionally more CPU resources than memory or RAM, ideal for more compute-intensive applications 
Storage and I/O Optimised instance – high disk performance or proportionally high storage density per instance, ideal for applications that benefit from a high sequence of I/O performance across very large datasets. It has high levels of CPU, memory, and network performance.
